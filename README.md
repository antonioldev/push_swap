Push_Swap is the fourth project in the 42 School curriculum, a challenging endeavor that tests your skills in algorithm design and manipulation. The project revolves around sorting stacks of integers using a limited set of operations on two stacks, namely "push" and "swap".

This repository contains an implementation of the Push_Swap algorithm, meticulously crafted to efficiently sort stacks of integers with minimal moves. As part of the 42 School curriculum, Push_Swap challenges students to devise optimal sorting strategies, balancing complexity and efficiency to achieve the desired outcome.

The Push_Swap project encourages exploration, experimentation, and innovation in algorithmic problem-solving. Whether you're a student embarking on the journey through the 42 School curriculum or a developer seeking insights into efficient sorting algorithms, Push_Swap offers a stimulating challenge and an opportunity for growth.
